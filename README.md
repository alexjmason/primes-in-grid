# Primes in Grid
Finding primes in an N * N matrix

This repository is for implementing and testing finding primes in N*N matrices.
The project is is based on the 1989 puzzle by Gordon Lee, and is as follows:

Given a grid of numbers, how many distinct primes can you find embedded in the matrix, regarding that you can read the lines or part of them, in form vertical, horizontal or diagonal orientation, in both directions.
